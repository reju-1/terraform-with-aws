ğŸ”¥ Practice Tasks (For Expressions + Conditionals)

1. Extract all user names into a list.
2. Get only the users where role == "admin".
3. Get only the users where age >= 18 (adults).
4. Create a map of { name = role } from the users.
5. For each number, return "even" or "odd".
6. Filter numbers greater than 3.   <-- (added back for completeness)
7. Group users by role (key = role, value = list of names).

ğŸ‘‰ Use for-expressions, filtering (`if`), and conditionals (`? :`).
